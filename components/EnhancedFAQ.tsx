    question: 'What are the requirements for a skilled worker visa?',
    answer: 'Requirements vary by country, but generally include a valid job offer from a sponsored employer, proof of relevant skills/qualifications, passing a points-based assessment, and meeting English language requirements.'
  },
  {
    category: 'work',
    question: 'Can I bring my family with me on a work visa?',
    answer: 'Yes, in most cases, skilled worker visas allow you to bring your spouse and dependent children. They will typically be granted dependent visas which may also allow them to work or study.'
  },
  {
    category: 'student',
    question: 'Can I work while studying abroad?',
    answer: 'Most popular study destinations (like Canada, UK, Australia) allow international students to work part-time (usually up to 20 hours per week) during the academic term and full-time during scheduled breaks.'
  },
  {
    category: 'student',
    question: 'What is a Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP)?',

  {
    category: 'pr',
    question: 'How long does the Permanent Residency process take?',
    answer: 'Processing times vary wildly based on the pathway (e.g., Express Entry vs. Family Sponsorship) and the country. It can take anywhere from 6 months for highly skilled express pathways to 2+ years for other streams.'
  },
  {
    category: 'pr',
    question: 'What is a points-based immigration system?',
    answer: 'Countries like Canada and Australia use a points system to evaluate candidates for PR. Points are awarded for age, education, work experience, language proficiency, and adaptability.'
  },
  {
    category: 'appeals',
    question: 'My visa was refused. What are my options?',
    answer: 'Depending on the country and visa type, you may have the option to appeal the decision, request an administrative review, or reapply with stronger evidence addressing the refusal reasons. Consulting an immigration lawyer immediately is highly recommended.'
  },
  {
    category: 'appeals',
    question: 'Can I appeal a deportation order?',
    answer: 'Yes, deportation orders can often be appealed on humanitarian and compassionate grounds, risk to life in the home country, or procedural errors. Time is critical, so immediate legal counsel is necessary.'
